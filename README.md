This is a theme component that adds a button with a URL to the `topic-category` component in tagged topic pages.

The link for Homepage appears whenever `test-tag` is attached to the topic.

Settings look like this:

To optimise the tag checking process, you can add suffixes in the setting as well. This is to make sure the theme component doesn't scan every single topic page.

For example, if you have group of tags ending in `-event` or such, you cna add it in the suffix section so that only topics tagged with tags ending in `-event` will be checked.
